# Table-Football-Scorekeeper API

A simple REST API for managing players, teams, and games in a table football scorekeeping system.
Built with Java, Maven, and SQLite.

## üöÄ Features
- Manage Players (add, update, delete, list)
- Manage Teams (singles & doubles)
- Manage Games (track scores & winners)
- Built-in validation & error handling 
- Lightweight persistence with SQLite

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- Java 17+
- Maven (build & dependency management)
- SQLite (lightweight embedded database)
- JUnit 5 + Mockito (unit testing)
- Docker (containerized deployment)

## üì¶ Getting started
- Install Docker (if not already installed)
- Pull the image: 
```bash
docker pull triinlutsoja/football-api:latest
```
- Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 triinlutsoja/football-api:latest
```
- (Optional) To persist data, you can mount a local folder for the SQLite database:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DB_PATH=/app/data/table_football_db.db -v /path/on/host:/app/data triinlutsoja/football-api:latest
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Replace /path/on/host with the full path on your computer where you want the database stored. The folder will 
contain your *.db file and preserve data between runs.
- Stop the container: 
```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Replace <container_id_or_name> with the container name or id.

## üìñ Usage

The API runs by default on http://localhost:8080. You can interact with it using tools like Postman, curl, or the 
frontend app.
